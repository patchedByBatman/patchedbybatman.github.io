## Aim:
<p>
The articles in this sub-base aim to showcase and explain the implementation details of embedded systems through the programming of Arduino UNO. The code will be mainly written in C++ and we will be using Arduino IDE 2.0.
</p>

<p>
Though, we will be programming an Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE,  each article will cover both bare-metal programming and its equivalent Arduino high-level functions.
